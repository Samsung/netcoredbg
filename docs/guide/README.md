# The NetCoreDbg Developer's Guide.

This is an easy user guide to the NetCoreDbg C# debugger.

## Downloads:

Binary releases are available here on [Github](https://github.com/Samsung/netcoredbg/releases).

## Compiling:

On Linux, Install `dia`, `rsvg-convert`, and most of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/), then run `make`.

The following shell commands are a good start:

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install dia
$ sudo apt install texlive-latex-base texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-fonts-extra texlive-latex-extra
$ sudo apt install texlive-binaries
$ sudo apt install librsvg2-bin
```

This automates the generation of available diagrams from the respective .dia files.

*Note: If you manage to automate the process on any other OS, please share it here on Github so that our team can review it!*
